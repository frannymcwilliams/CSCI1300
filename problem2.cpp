 * ALGORITHM:
 * 1. Declare int variables days, hours, mins, secs
 * 2. Initialize variables through calculating their values
 * 3. Print out the numSeconds valued entered, followed by the conversion
 * Input parameters: number of seconds
 * Output: String with the new conversion
 * Return: Nothing
